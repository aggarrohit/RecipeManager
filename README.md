# RecipeManager - Foodmora
This is a recipe management system created using java and it runs in the terminal as it doesn't have any GUI. <br />
It has two roles i.e. User and Dietitian. <br />
Dietitans can create/edit recipes and view recipes in the recipe pool. <br />
Users can also view recipes in the recipe pool. <br />
Users can create week by entering the week number and system will auto assign recipes which are least used in current and nearby weeks. <br />
Users can view the created weeks and recipes assigned to each day of the week. <br />
I have provided 15 sample recipes for demo purpose. <br />
All the created recipes and weeks will remain saved during runtime but will get deleted when the application is terminated.
